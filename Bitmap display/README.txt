Lab 4: Paint application
Spring 2022

DESCRIPTION
In this lab, we will create an application that will take user input from the keyboard to draw patterns over a Bitmap display.

FILES
lab4_part1.asm
This file includes the assembly code of part1, which takes an (x,y) coordinate of a Bitmap pixel, as well as the base address for display, and converts it to the actual main memory address.
lab4_part2.asm
This file includes the assembly code of part2, which takes keyboard input and converts that to movement of a pixel.

INSTRUCTIONS
This program is intended to be run using the RISCV Assembler and Runtime Simulator
(RARS). Enter the test case as a program argument and run using RARS.
